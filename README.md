# will-it-fly

This repository is in an experimental phase and contains bugs.
It is **highly recommended** to use a **virtual environment** (`venv`) or a **conda environment** for this project, as some dependencies require specific versions.

In order to access the entire repo use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NirranjanOfficial/will-it-fly.git
cd will-it-fly
```

Now get into the will-it-fly directory and install the dependencies!

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To use the drone simulation tools:
* On Ubuntu: Install QGroundControl (QGCS) and connect it to SITL.

* On Windows: Use Mission Planner for SITL integration and monitoring.
